Something as normal as a cough has been commanding our attention for the past year or so, due to the novel coronavirus which has been raging through the world for almost a year and a half. With our nation facing the successive waves of the dreaded virus, millions of lives were affected.

Thus **in-COVID** was created that helps one to reach out for resources like hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, medicines, teleconsultation, and some more essentials for COVID-19 patients.


This repository contains the **Backend** for in-COVID app.
#
**NOTE:**
We kept the application up and running for roughly 3 months and have pulled the plug on the server and the app. Ultimately, we decided that the backbone and the infrastructure that we created could be improved upon or used for other causes.
