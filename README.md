Something as normal as a cough has been commanding our attention for the past year or so, due to the novel coronavirus which has been raging through the world for almost a year and a half. With our nation facing the successive waves of the dreaded virus, millions of lives were affected.

Thus **in-COVID** was created that helps one to reach out for resources like hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, medicines, teleconsultation, and some more essentials for COVID-19 patients.


This repository contains the **Backend** for in-COVID app.
